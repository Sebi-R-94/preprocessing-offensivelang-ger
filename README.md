# Preprocessing and the Detection of Offensive Language in German Tweets

This is the repository for my project "Preprocessing and the Detection of Offensive Language in German Tweets: How Different Methods May Improve the Performance of
Different Classifiers", which was carried out within the course "Language Technology: Research and Development" in the MA Language Technology programme at Uppsala University. In my project I selected three classifier architectures that were previously used in studies on offensive language detection (BERT, SVM and AdaBoost with Decision Trees as a base classifier). I then prepared different versions of the GermEval 2019 dataset where different preprocessing methods were applied. The methods in questions were replacing emojis with text, splitting camel-cased hashtags and lowercasing/truecasing to handle the capitalisation of German. The file preprocess.py contains the preprocessing methods that were applied. The respective data can be found here : https://projects.fzai.h-da.de/iggsa/data-2019/, a detailed report on the project can be found in the file report.py.
